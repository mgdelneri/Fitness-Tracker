# Fitness-Tracker

## GOAL

The goal of this project was to code the back-end to a Fitness Tracker app. We were provided with the front-end of the code. The assignment required us to create a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express. 

Once finalized, the Fitness Tracker app provides the user with a space to view, create, and track daily workouts. The user has to be able to log resistance or cardio exercises in a workout on any given day. The user should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of each exercise. In a cardio exercise, the user can also track the distance travelled. 

## PROCESS

After looking through the assignment instructions, I carefully looked over the starter code, trying to understand how all of the pieces fit together. I simultaneously looked over the material from the last unit, which was about MongoDB and Mongoose. I also went back and reviewed Express. 

I then created the folders and files I thought would be necessary for the app to work correctly. I had to eventually make changes to my initial folder/file structure, but this allowed me to better vistualize my first version of pseudo code.
